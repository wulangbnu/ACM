<p>If a submission is not correct it will be returned with the
<em>first</em> applicable error message from the following list. A
20-minute time penalty will be assessed for each incorrect
submission. The error messages are described below.

<ol>
  <li>Submission Error
  </li>
  <li>Run-time Error
  </li>
  <li>Time Limit Exceeded
  </li>
  <li>Wrong Answer
  </li>
  <li>Presentation Error
  </li>
</ol>

<p><b>Submission Error. </b>
This indicates a violation of the basic contest rules. Teams should
never get a <i>Submission Error</i>, but in the heat of competition
they sometimes make silly mistakes. Submission errors include (but
are not limited to)
</p>

<ul>
  <li>compilation errors (warnings are OK)
  </li>
  <li>submitting the wrong problem
  </li>
  <li>submitting the executable instead of the source code
  </li>
  <li>submitting a program consisting of more than one source file
  </li>
  <li>using the wrong source or input file name
  </li>
  <li>including a drive and/or path with a file name
  </li>
  <li>prompting and waiting for keyboard input (see also <i>Time Limit
Exceeded</i>).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Run-time Error.</b>
The program crashed when run. Examples of run-time errors include (but
are not limited to)
</p>

<ul>
  <li>stack overflows
  </li>
  <li>I/O errors
  </li>
  <li>heap overflows
  </li>
  <li>invalid memory references (<i>e.g.</i>, dereferencing a null
pointer)
  </li>
  <li>bizarre behavior (garbage on screen, beeping, keyboard lockup,
...).
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Time Limit Exceeded.</b>
The program ran (without crashing) for more than one minute. It may or
may not have produced any output. This error may indicate that the
program simply runs too slowly or that it was silently waiting for
keyboard input, but it usually means that it got stuck in an infinite
loop.
</p>

<p><b>Wrong Answer.</b>
The program ran to completion in one minute or less but produced one
or more incorrect answers. A program that produces unsorted output
when the problem calls for sorted output will receive this error.
</p>

<p><b>Presentation Error.</b>
The program ran to completion in one minute or less, produced answers
that appear to contain essentially the same information as the correct
answers, but formatted the output incorrectly in one or more cases.
Examples of incorrect formatting include (but are not limited to)
</p>

<ul>
  <li>misspelled words or omitted non-essential words
  </li>
  <li>wrong case (<i>e.g.</i>, uppercase instead of lowercase)
  </li>
  <li>too few or too many spaces
  </li>
  <li>wrong number of significant digits in numeric output
  </li>
  <li>incorrect or missing punctuation
  </li>
  <li>extra blank lines.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> Receiving a <i>Presentation Error</i> guarantees that
there are one or more formatting errors, and indicates that the judges
did not see any wrong answers based on a brief visual inspection.
However, it is not a <em>guarantee</em> that the program produced no
incorrect answers.
